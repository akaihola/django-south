Contributing to South
---------------------

Contributions to South are very welcome.
Send your patches to andrew at aeracode.org; if you send in a couple of good
patches, you'll get write access to the subversion repository.

The main area that needs work is the expansion of the database abstraction
layer to cover more databases and more commands, although of course any other
areas are welcome!
